This is a hackathon project
===========================

This means you probably don't want to reuse any part of this code, anywhere.

The end result is a [visualization of government surveillance through its possible targets](http://mattischneider.fr/h4yr/).

If you're interested in reusing the data, better look [here](http://mattischneider.fr/h4yr/sources.html) than in the code.

The result is all in the `index.html` file. The `data` folder contains all the pipes and temporary artifacts of data mangling. Stuff done under 48h is not intended for reuse, so have a look at it if you're interested, but don't expect any of those scripts to work.

This is a hackathon project, so the parts I wrote are obviously under the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/).
